I'm a first-year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at the Institute of Computing at the University of Campinas (IC - UNICAMP). I'm also currently finishing my Master's dissertation in Math Modelling at the School of Applied Math at FGV, to be presented in the next months. I hold a BSc degree in Applied Math from the same institution. In the last few years, I have been a researcher at the [Visual Data Science Lab], working on visualization techniques for spatiotemporal data. I also had the opportunity to be a visiting researcher in the VIDA Lab at NYU Tandon, working with deep learning techniques to infer socioeconomic indexes from remote sensing data.

At UNICAMP, I'm a member of the Hub of Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Architectures ([HIAAC](https://hiaac.unicamp.br/)), performing research in Trusthyworth AI, mainly in the area of fairness and explainability.
